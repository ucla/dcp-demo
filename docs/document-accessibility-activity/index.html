            CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
         </h2>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
            bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
            book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
            it, &lsquo;and what is the use of a book,&rsquo; thought Alice &lsquo;without pictures or
            conversations?&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot
            day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making
            a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
            daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            There was nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
            <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &lsquo;Oh dear! Oh
            dear! I shall be late!&rsquo; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
            to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
            seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of
            its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started
            to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen
            a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
            burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately
            was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in
            the world she was to get out again.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
            dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
            about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
            well.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty
            of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to
            happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
            coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the
            sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and
            book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She
            took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled
            &lsquo;ORANGE MARMALADE&rsquo;, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did
            not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put
            it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; thought Alice to herself, &lsquo;after such a fall as this, I shall
            think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they&rsquo;ll all think me at
            home! Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
            the house!&rsquo; (Which was very likely true.)
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Down, down, down. Would the fall <i>never</i> come to an end! &lsquo;I wonder how many
            miles I&rsquo;ve fallen by this time?&rsquo; she said aloud. &lsquo;I must be getting
            somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
            thousand miles down, I think&mdash;&rsquo; (for, you see, Alice had learnt
            several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
            this was not a <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as
            there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it
            over) &lsquo;&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s about the right distance&mdash;but then I wonder
            what Latitude or Longitude I&rsquo;ve got to?&rsquo; (Alice had no idea what Latitude
            was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Presently she began again. &lsquo;I wonder if I shall fall right <i>through</i> the
            earth! How funny it&rsquo;ll seem to come out among the people that walk with
            their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think&mdash;&rsquo; (she was rather
            glad there <i>was</i> no one listening, this time, as it didn&rsquo;t sound at all the
            right word) &lsquo;&mdash;but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
            country is, you know. Please, Ma&rsquo;am, is this New Zealand or Australia?&rsquo; 
            (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke&mdash;fancy <i>curtseying</i> as you&rsquo;re
            falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) &lsquo;And what an
            ignorant little girl she&rsquo;ll think me for asking! No, it&rsquo;ll never do to
            ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
            talking again. &lsquo;Dinah&rsquo;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&rsquo; 
            (Dinah was the cat.) &lsquo;I hope they&rsquo;ll remember her saucer of milk at
            tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
            mice in the air, I&rsquo;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&rsquo;s very
            like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&rsquo; And here Alice
            began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
            sort of way, &lsquo;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&rsquo; and sometimes, &lsquo;Do bats
            eat cats?&rsquo; for, you see, as she couldn&rsquo;t answer either question, it didn&rsquo;t
            much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and
            had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and
            saying to her very earnestly, &lsquo;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever
            eat a bat?&rsquo; when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of
            sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
            she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long
            passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There
            was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just
            in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, &lsquo;Oh my ears and whiskers,
            how late it&rsquo;s getting!&rsquo; She was close behind it when she turned the
            corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a
            long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
            Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
            door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get
            out again.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
            glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice&rsquo;s first
            thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but,
            alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at
            any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round,
            she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was
            a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key
            in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much
            larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into
            the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark
            hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool
            fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; &lsquo;and
            even if my head would go through,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;it would be of
            very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like
            a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.&rsquo; For, you see,
            so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to
            think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back
            to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate
            a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she
            found a little bottle on it, (&lsquo;which certainly was not here before,&rsquo; said
            Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words
            &lsquo;DRINK ME&rsquo; beautifully printed on it in large letters.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            It was all very well to say &lsquo;Drink me,&rsquo; but the wise little Alice was not
            going to do <i>that</i> in a hurry. &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll look first,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and see
            whether it&rsquo;s marked &ldquo;<i>poison</i>&rdquo; or not&rsquo;; for she had read several nice little
            histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts
            and other unpleasant things, all because they <i>would</i> not remember the
            simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker
            will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger
            <i>very</i> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten
            that, if you drink much from a bottle marked &lsquo;poison,&rsquo; it is almost
            certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            However, this bottle was <i>not</i> marked &lsquo;poison,&rsquo; so Alice ventured to taste
            it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of
            cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered
            toast,) she very soon finished it off.
         </p>

         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;What a curious feeling!&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;I must be shutting up like a
            telescope.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
            brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
            through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
            waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
            she felt a little nervous about this; &lsquo;for it might end, you know,&rsquo; said
            Alice to herself, &lsquo;in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
            what I should be like then?&rsquo; And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
            candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
            ever having seen such a thing.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
            into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
            door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went
            back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she
            could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to
            climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when
            she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and
            cried.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Come, there&rsquo;s no use in crying like that!&rsquo; said Alice to herself, rather
            sharply; &lsquo;I advise you to leave off this minute!&rsquo; She generally gave
            herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and
            sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes;
            and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated
            herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this
            curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s no
            use now,&rsquo; thought poor Alice, &lsquo;to pretend to be two people! Why, there&rsquo;s
            hardly enough of me left to make <i>one</i> respectable person!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
            she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words &lsquo;EAT
            ME&rsquo; were beautifully marked in currants. &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll eat it,&rsquo; said Alice,
            &lsquo;and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me
            grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I&rsquo;ll get into the
            garden, and I don&rsquo;t care which happens!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, &lsquo;Which way? Which
            way?&rsquo;, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
            growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
            size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had
            got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to
            happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
            common way.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

            CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears
         </h2>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Curiouser and curiouser!&rsquo; cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
            for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); &lsquo;now I&rsquo;m
            opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!&rsquo; 
            (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
            sight, they were getting so far off). &lsquo;Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
            who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I&rsquo;m sure <i>I</i>
            shan&rsquo;t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
            about you: you must manage the best way you can;&mdash;but I must be kind
            to them,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;or perhaps they won&rsquo;t walk the way I want to go!
            Let me see: I&rsquo;ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. &lsquo;They must go
            by the carrier,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;and how funny it&rsquo;ll seem, sending presents
            to one&rsquo;s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
         </p>
         <pre xml:space="preserve">
     Alice&rsquo;s Right Foot, Esq.
       Hearthrug,
         near The Fender,
           (with Alice&rsquo;s love).
</pre>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Oh dear, what nonsense I&rsquo;m talking!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
            now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
            key and hurried off to the garden door.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
            look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
            hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;a great girl like
            you,&rsquo; (she might well say this), &lsquo;to go on crying in this way! Stop this
            moment, I tell you!&rsquo; But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
            tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep
            and reaching half down the hall.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she
            hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit
            returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand
            and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry,
            muttering to himself as he came, &lsquo;Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won&rsquo;t
            she be savage if I&rsquo;ve kept her waiting!&rsquo; Alice felt so desperate that she
            was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she
            began, in a low, timid voice, &lsquo;If you please, sir&mdash;&rsquo; The Rabbit
            started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried
            away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept
            fanning herself all the time she went on talking: &lsquo;Dear, dear! How queer
            everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder
            if I&rsquo;ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got
            up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
            But if I&rsquo;m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,
            <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the great puzzle!&rsquo; And she began thinking over all the children she
            knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been
            changed for any of them.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not Ada,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;for her hair goes in such long
            ringlets, and mine doesn&rsquo;t go in ringlets at all; and I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t be
            Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very
            little! Besides, <i>she&rsquo;s</i> she, and <i>I&rsquo;m</i> I, and&mdash;oh dear, how puzzling it
            all is! I&rsquo;ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four
            times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven
            is&mdash;oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the
            Multiplication Table doesn&rsquo;t signify: let&rsquo;s try Geography. London is the
            capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome&mdash;no,
            <i>that&rsquo;s</i> all wrong, I&rsquo;m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I&rsquo;ll
            try and say &ldquo;<i>How doth the little</i>&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; and she crossed her hands on her
            lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice
            sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they
            used to do:&mdash;
         </p>
         <pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;How doth the little crocodile
      Improve his shining tail,
     And pour the waters of the Nile
      On every golden scale!

     &lsquo;How cheerfully he seems to grin,
      How neatly spread his claws,
     And welcome little fishes in
      With gently smiling jaws!&rsquo; 
</pre>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure those are not the right words,&rsquo; said poor Alice, and her eyes
            filled with tears again as she went on, &lsquo;I must be Mabel after all, and I
            shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no
            toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I&rsquo;ve made up
            my mind about it; if I&rsquo;m Mabel, I&rsquo;ll stay down here! It&rsquo;ll be no use their
            putting their heads down and saying &ldquo;Come up again, dear!&rdquo; I shall only
            look up and say &ldquo;Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like
            being that person, I&rsquo;ll come up: if not, I&rsquo;ll stay down here till I&rsquo;m
            somebody else&rdquo;&mdash;but, oh dear!&rsquo; cried Alice, with a sudden burst of
            tears, &lsquo;I do wish they <i>would</i> put their heads down! I am so <i>very</i> tired of
            being all alone here!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
            that she had put on one of the Rabbit&rsquo;s little white kid gloves while she
            was talking. &lsquo;How <i>can</i> I have done that?&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;I must be growing
            small again.&rsquo; She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it,
            and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet
            high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the
            cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily,
            just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;That <i>was</i> a narrow escape!&rsquo; said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
            sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; &lsquo;and now
            for the garden!&rsquo; and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but,
            alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying
            on the glass table as before, &lsquo;and things are worse than ever,&rsquo; thought
            the poor child, &lsquo;for I never was so small as this before, never! And I
            declare it&rsquo;s too bad, that it is!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
            she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had
            somehow fallen into the sea, &lsquo;and in that case I can go back by railway,&rsquo; 
            she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and
            had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English
            coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children
            digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and
            behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in
            the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t cried so much!&rsquo; said Alice, as she swam about, trying to
            find her way out. &lsquo;I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being
            drowned in my own tears! That <i>will</i> be a queer thing, to be sure! However,
            everything is queer to-day.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
            off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it
            must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she
            was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped
            in like herself.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Would it be of any use, now,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;to speak to this mouse?
            Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely
            it can talk: at any rate, there&rsquo;s no harm in trying.&rsquo; So she began: &lsquo;O
            Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming
            about here, O Mouse!&rsquo; (Alice thought this must be the right way of
            speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she
            remembered having seen in her brother&rsquo;s Latin Grammar, &lsquo;A mouse&mdash;of a
            mouse&mdash;to a mouse&mdash;a mouse&mdash;O mouse!&rsquo;) The Mouse looked at
            her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
            eyes, but it said nothing.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t understand English,&rsquo; thought Alice; &lsquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s a
            French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.&rsquo; (For, with all her
            knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything
            had happened.) So she began again: &lsquo;Ou est ma chatte?&rsquo; which was the first
            sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of
            the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. &lsquo;Oh, I beg your
            pardon!&rsquo; cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal&rsquo;s
            feelings. &lsquo;I quite forgot you didn&rsquo;t like cats.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Not like cats!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. &lsquo;Would
            <i>you</i> like cats if you were me?&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Well, perhaps not,&rsquo; said Alice in a soothing tone: &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be angry about
            it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you&rsquo;d take a
            fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,&rsquo; 
            Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, &lsquo;and
            she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her
            face&mdash;and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse&mdash;and she&rsquo;s such
            a capital one for catching mice&mdash;oh, I beg your pardon!&rsquo; cried Alice
            again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt
            certain it must be really offended. &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t talk about her any more if
            you&rsquo;d rather not.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;We indeed!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
            tail. &lsquo;As if <i>I</i> would talk on such a subject! Our family always <i>hated</i> cats:
            nasty, low, vulgar things! Don&rsquo;t let me hear the name again!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t indeed!&rsquo; said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
            conversation. &lsquo;Are you&mdash;are you fond&mdash;of&mdash;of dogs?&rsquo; The
            Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: &lsquo;There is such a nice
            little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed
            terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it&rsquo;ll fetch
            things when you throw them, and it&rsquo;ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and
            all sorts of things&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember half of them&mdash;and it
            belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it&rsquo;s so useful, it&rsquo;s worth a
            hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and&mdash;oh dear!&rsquo; cried
            Alice in a sorrowful tone, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve offended it again!&rsquo; For the
            Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite
            a commotion in the pool as it went.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            So she called softly after it, &lsquo;Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
            won&rsquo;t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don&rsquo;t like them!&rsquo; When the
            Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
            was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
            trembling voice, &lsquo;Let us get to the shore, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you my
            history, and you&rsquo;ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
            birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a
            Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
            way, and the whole party swam to the shore.

            CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
         </h2>
         <p tabindex="0">
            They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank&mdash;the
            birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to
            them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
            consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
            to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known
            them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory,
            who at last turned sulky, and would only say, &lsquo;I am older than you, and
            must know better&rsquo;; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old
            it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no
            more to be said.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
            called out, &lsquo;Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> soon make you
            dry enough!&rsquo; They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in
            the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure
            she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Ahem!&rsquo; said the Mouse with an important air, &lsquo;are you all ready? This is
            the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! &ldquo;William the
            Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by
            the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to
            usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and
            Northumbria&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; said the Lory, with a shiver.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I beg your pardon!&rsquo; said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: &lsquo;Did you
            speak?&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Not I!&rsquo; said the Lory hastily.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I thought you did,&rsquo; said the Mouse. &lsquo;&mdash;I proceed. &ldquo;Edwin and Morcar,
            the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,
            the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Found <i>what</i>?&rsquo; said the Duck.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Found <i>it</i>,&rsquo; the Mouse replied rather crossly: &lsquo;of course you know what
            &ldquo;it&rdquo; means.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I know what &ldquo;it&rdquo; means well enough, when <i>I</i> find a thing,&rsquo; said the Duck:
            &lsquo;it&rsquo;s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop
            find?&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, &lsquo;&ldquo;&mdash;found
            it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
            crown. William&rsquo;s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his
            Normans&mdash;&rdquo; How are you getting on now, my dear?&rsquo; it continued,
            turning to Alice as it spoke.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;As wet as ever,&rsquo; said Alice in a melancholy tone: &lsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t seem to dry
            me at all.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, &lsquo;I move that
            the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies&mdash;&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Speak English!&rsquo; said the Eaglet. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know the meaning of half those
            long words, and, what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t believe you do either!&rsquo; And the
            Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
            tittered audibly.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;What I was going to say,&rsquo; said the Dodo in an offended tone, &lsquo;was, that
            the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;What <i>is</i> a Caucus-race?&rsquo; said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but
            the Dodo had paused as if it thought that <i>somebody</i> ought to speak, and no
            one else seemed inclined to say anything.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the Dodo, &lsquo;the best way to explain it is to do it.&rsquo; (And, as
            you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you
            how the Dodo managed it.)
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (&lsquo;the exact shape
            doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rsquo; it said,) and then all the party were placed along the
            course, here and there. There was no &lsquo;One, two, three, and away,&rsquo; but they
            began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it
            was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been
            running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly
            called out &lsquo;The race is over!&rsquo; and they all crowded round it, panting, and
            asking, &lsquo;But who has won?&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
            and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the
            position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him),
            while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, &lsquo;<i>Everybody</i> has
            won, and all must have prizes.&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;But who is to give the prizes?&rsquo; quite a chorus of voices asked.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Why, <i>she</i>, of course,&rsquo; said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
            and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
            way, &lsquo;Prizes! Prizes!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
            pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not
            got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one
            a-piece all round.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;But she must have a prize herself, you know,&rsquo; said the Mouse.

            &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; the Dodo replied very gravely. &lsquo;What else have you got in
            your pocket?&rsquo; he went on, turning to Alice.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Only a thimble,&rsquo; said Alice sadly.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Hand it over here,&rsquo; said the Dodo.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
            presented the thimble, saying &lsquo;We beg your acceptance of this elegant
            thimble&rsquo;; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
            that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to
            say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
            could.

            The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
            confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs,
            and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it
            was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse
            to tell them something more.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;You promised to tell me your history, you know,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;and why it
            is you hate&mdash;C and D,&rsquo; she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
            would be offended again.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Mine is a long and a sad tale!&rsquo; said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
            sighing.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;It <i>is</i> a long tail, certainly,&rsquo; said Alice, looking down with wonder at
            the Mouse&rsquo;s tail; &lsquo;but why do you call it sad?&rsquo; And she kept on puzzling
            about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
            something like this:&mdash;
         </p>
         <pre xml:space="preserve">
         &lsquo;Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     &ldquo;Let us
      both go to
       law: <i>I</i> will
        prosecute
         <i>you</i>.&mdash;Come,
           I&rsquo;ll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I&rsquo;ve
    nothing
    to do.&rdquo;
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, &ldquo;Such
        a trial,
         dear Sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.&rdquo;
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
        judge, I&rsquo;ll
         be jury,&rdquo;
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;You are not attending!&rsquo; said the Mouse to Alice severely. &lsquo;What are you
            thinking of?&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Alice very humbly: &lsquo;you had got to the fifth
            bend, I think?&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I had <i>not</i>!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;A knot!&rsquo; said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
            anxiously about her. &lsquo;Oh, do let me help to undo it!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I shall do nothing of the sort,&rsquo; said the Mouse, getting up and walking
            away. &lsquo;You insult me by talking such nonsense!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it!&rsquo; pleaded poor Alice. &lsquo;But you&rsquo;re so easily offended,
            you know!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            The Mouse only growled in reply.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;Please come back and finish your story!&rsquo; Alice called after it; and the
            others all joined in chorus, &lsquo;Yes, please do!&rsquo; but the Mouse only shook
            its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;What a pity it wouldn&rsquo;t stay!&rsquo; sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
            out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
            daughter &lsquo;Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose <i>your</i>
            temper!&rsquo; &lsquo;Hold your tongue, Ma!&rsquo; said the young Crab, a little snappishly.
            &lsquo;You&rsquo;re enough to try the patience of an oyster!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!&rsquo; said Alice aloud, addressing
            nobody in particular. &lsquo;She&rsquo;d soon fetch it back!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?&rsquo; said the Lory.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
            &lsquo;Dinah&rsquo;s our cat. And she&rsquo;s such a capital one for catching mice you can&rsquo;t
            think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she&rsquo;ll eat a
            little bird as soon as look at it!&rsquo; 
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
            birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
            carefully, remarking, &lsquo;I really must be getting home; the night-air
            doesn&rsquo;t suit my throat!&rsquo; and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
            its children, &lsquo;Come away, my dears! It&rsquo;s high time you were all in bed!&rsquo; 
            On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
         </p>
         <p tabindex="0">
            &lsquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t mentioned Dinah!&rsquo; she said to herself in a melancholy
            tone. &lsquo;Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s the best
            cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any
            more!&rsquo; And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely
            and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little
            pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half
            hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish
            his story.
